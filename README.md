# Blume Protocol

Blume is a comprehensive DeFi ecosystem built on Ethereum, offering automated market making, time-locked staking, liquid staking, and secure vault solutions. The protocol is designed with security-first principles and implements battle-tested mechanisms to ensure user funds remain safe while maximizing yield opportunities.

## Overview

Blume Protocol consists of five core smart contracts that work together to provide a complete DeFi experience:

- **BLX Token**: The native governance and utility token
- **BLX Pool**: Automated Market Maker (AMM) for token swaps and liquidity provision
- **Tiered Staking**: Time-locked staking with variable APR based on lock duration
- **Liquid Staking**: Liquid staking system that issues tradeable stBLX tokens
- **BLX Vault**: Secure time-locked vault with automated staking features
